Using Docker
Creating a Dockerfile:
Create a Dockerfile in your project directory. This file defines your application environment. Hereâ€™s an example for a Python application:

Dockerfile
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
Building and Running the Docker Container:
Open a terminal in the directory containing your Dockerfile and run:
docker build -t my-python-app .
docker run -p 4000:80 my-python-app

Using Docker Compose:
Docker Compose allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Create a docker-compose.yml file:
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "4000:80"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
